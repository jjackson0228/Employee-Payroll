# Employee-Payroll

Project to write a code in javascript to log employee first and last name and salary into the table HTML pre-written code. Added code to make a loop to add a first name and a last name and salary into a table with a salary with a USD and decimal points added even if typed without them. When adding more than one name and salary I made a code to get the average salary of everyone entered into the payroll tracker. It is shown in the inspect page and in the console log. I also added a code to pick a random winner of all the names entered. It is also shown in the console log if you right click and inspect the page.
